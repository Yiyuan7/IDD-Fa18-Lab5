## Putting it All Together

Include here:
1. Your Arduino code.


1. `.stl` or `.svg` files for your "bopper" â€” if you use some other technique, include the respective supporting material.

I used a plastic rectangle I found in maker lab and some cardboard. I but the cutboard to the shape I need.

1. At least one photo of your useless box taken in the MakerLab's Portable Photo Studio (or somewhere else, but of similar quality).
